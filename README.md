# COVID-19-Theoretical-Approach


Our main objective is to predict if an individual has had the COVID depending on the
certain features that it presents. The features in which we will emphasize will be
detailed in the next section.
For solving this problem, we will implement a supervised learning approach creating
different types of detectors and evaluating them using ROC curves (AUROC
evaluation).
